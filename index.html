	<h1>Introduction to 3D Printing</h1>

<div class="slide">
	<h1>What is 3D Printing?</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Like a paper printer, but uses plastic</li>
		<li>1 layer at a time</li>
		<li>The print head can move up (Z direction)</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="handout">
          A 3D printer of the type most commonly used by hobbyists, a
          so-called 'Fused Deposition Modeling' printer, works by
          laying down one layer of plastic at a time, then moving the
          print head upward, and putting another layer on top. This
          method of 3D printing is simple and effective, but there are
          certain limits to what shapes can be successfully printed.
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h1>What is 3D Printing Useful For?</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Design on the computer, then make it real</li>
		<li>Download, modify, print, and share</li>
		<li>Make objects that don't exist, can't be bought in stores</li>
                <li>Prototype designs</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="handout">
          3D printing allows you to design objects, whether artistic
          or functional, using powerful modeling tools on a computer,
          where you can make changes essentially for free until you
          are happy with the design. Then you can start the printer
          and make the object out of plastic. 

          You can also easily share your designs with others, or
          download other people's designs from the Internet and then
          print them as they are, or make your own modifications,
          print, and share them. This enables more rapid development
          of useful designs, because everyone can build off of each
          others' work.

          Sometimes when designing a new tool or toy, or trying to fix
          something around the house, you need a piece of plastic in a
          shape that you cannot simply buy from the store, or even
          order from anywhere. That shape may not exist at all. In
          this case, you can design the shape you need and then print
          it. Later you can even use your 3D prints to create silicone
          or other types of molds and mass-produce copies yourself.

          Finally, if you are trying to design something, and need to
          test your design to see how well it fits or functions, 3D
          printing allows you to do this cheaply, before spending a
          lot of time and money on the tooling to have something
          manufactured.
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h1>Example: Blue Canary Night Light</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Did not exist before</li>
                <li>I knew how to sculpt shapes in Blender</li>
                <li>Designed, went through a few prototypes</li>
                <li>Finally finished piece and used to make molds, produce</li>
                <li>Eventually went to mass-production via contract manufacturer</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="handout">
          My first use of 3D printing was to develop a product, a blue
          canary night light. I designed the canary in a 3D modeling
          program called Blender, made some 3D renderings of it, and
          then sent off the design to a 3D printing service called
          Shapeways to have the first prototype printed. I tried
          mounting this on a night light I found at the store, decided
          it needed some tweaks and a change in size, and then had it
          printed again by Shapeways. Finally, I arrived at a design
          with which I was happy. I then sanded the print down, used
          it to make a silicone mold, and started producing my own
          copies using two-part urethane resin and blue dye.

          Eventually, I was able to prove to myself that the market
          existed for mass manufacturing, and hired a contract
          manufacturer to make the lights for me. I have been selling
          them for three years now, with hundreds of thousands of
          dollars in sales. I do not have the sculpting skills to have
          done this with hand tools, and the iterations of the design
          would have been much more costly in terms of time.

        </table>
	<div class="handout">
          I started with a random image of a yellow canary on the
          Internet, and looked at that as a reference while I modeled
          the canary in Blender, which is beyond the scope of this
          talk, but I'm not and never have been an advanced Blender
          user. I then gradually changed the model until I was happy
          with it, and used the renders shown here to gauge interest
          in my project on my web site, as well as to envision how the
          model would look when made.

        </ol>
	<div class="handout">
          The process of going from a an idea to a 3D print involves
          several steps. First, you have to translate the idea into a
          computer model of some sort. Typically you use an art-type
          program (Blender or various commercial packages, Google
          SketchUp) to sculpt things, a computer-aided-drafting or CAD
          program (OpenSCAD, Freecad, stuff by Autodesk) for things
          that need to have specific dimensions, or you can even take
          data from the real world (3D scanner, medical imaging) and
          convert that into a computer model. There are limits to what
          a fused deposition modeling printer can print. Large
          overhangs will either fail (can't print into empty space),
          or require you to add support material to the design or the
          processing.

          Once the computer model is created, it must be processed
          into instructions for the printer. This is done using a
          so-called slicing program, because it slices the model into
          layers. This step will have problems if your model is not
          water-tight, or has other problems like incorrect
          normals. There are many guides online for fixing these
          problems. This step is also very sensitive to the settings
          you use for slicing. They must be correct for your printer,
          for the plastic you're using, and even for the physical
          environment around the printer (temperature, air
          movement). Generally you will want to review your settings
          each time you make a print to be sure that they match your
          goal. For instance, for mechanical objects you usually want
          a solid print. For artistic objects, a hollow or
          mostly-hollow print may suffice and will make your print
          quicker, cheaper, and lighter.

	<h1>From Idea to Print (2/2)</h1>
        <ol start="4">
                <li>Load into printer control software (Pronterface, repsnapper, repraphost, ReplicatorG)</li>
                <li>Prepare printer (warm bed, hot end)</li>
                <li>Print</li>
                <li>Remove from bed/cleanup</li>
	</ol>

	<div class="handout">
          The slicing program outputs instructions for the
          printer. These are loaded into what's known as 'host
          software', a program used to control the printer before,
          during, and after a print. The host software is used to warm
          up any relevant parts of the printer, position the component
          axes of the printer appropriately, and start, run, and
          finish the print.
          
          Finally, once the print is complete, it must be carefully
          pried from the print bed (if using kapton or blue painters'
          tape), or it will separate from a glass bed once allowed to
          cool. You may find strings, blobs, or other defects in the
          print that are usually cleaned up with a sharp hobby knife
          or a pocketknife. Prints may then be finished if desired by
          sanding, painting, or acetone bath (beyond the scope of this
          presentation).

                <li>Heated Bed</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="handout">
          On RepRap type printers, the X axis generally moves the
          print head (extruder) side-to-side, the Y axis generally
          moves the print via the bed, and the Z axis generally moves
          the print head up from layer to layer. The electronics
          translate the printer instructions from the slicing software
          into movement of the printer, changes in temperature, and so
          on. The heated bed helps plastic to adhere during the print,
          and cools down to release the printed item when finished.

	<div class="handout">
          The extruder assembly takes in room-temperature plastic at one and, and pushes soft, hot thermoplastic of a different diameter out the other end. The motor drives a gear of some type (sprocket, hobbed bolt), which physically squeezes the filament and digs into it (possibly against an idler of some kind), pushing the filament into the hot end. The hot end consists of a barrel, held in an insulator to keep it from melting the printer and retain heat for heating plastic, a heating element to warm the barrel and the plastic, a thermistor to monitor the temperature, and a nozzle to shape the hot thermoplastic as it exits the barrel. If the nozzle gets too cold, the printing will stop, and the plastic will jam or strip out in the extruder assembly.
